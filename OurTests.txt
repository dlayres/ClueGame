We test that the board has 20 rows and 20 columns like our layout.

Then, we test that doors with four different directions work. We selected cells part of groups of two doors in a row
to make sure they work properly, as well as cells that have a door on the corner to make sure the direction
we specified is the correct direction. We also selected cells next to doors that aren't doors to make sure they
don't show up as a door, as well as walkways leading out of doors to make sure they aren't doors either.

Next, we test that our total number of doorways (18) match what the code recognizes as a door.

Finally, we test cells for their proper initials. We selected the cell at (0, 0) to make sure its initial was
correct, and then one cell from a few different rooms to test their room initials. We tested a cell from the
closet in the middle to check if it had an 'X' as its initial, and one from the bottom right room to see if its
initial was correct.
